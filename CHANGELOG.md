## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- 17c901b: Iterate on `CLIUtils.shell` command.

  ‚ö†Ô∏è The signature now throws:

  ```diff
  -static func shell(_ command: String) -> String
  +static func shell(_ command: String) throws -> String
  ```

### Patch Changes

- 995be85: Stop escaping slashes on `JSON` functions.

  Output examples:

  ```diff
  -foo\/bar
  +foo/bar
  ```

## 0.6.0 (2024-12-30)

### Feat

- **Swift 6 compatibility.** This was easier than I expected. The only challenge
  I faced (so far?) was creating a convenient utility to detect if a device is
  connected to an Apple Watch, which I (temporarily?) removed from the library
  and the demo.
- **`LabeledTextField` and Demo Form.** Forms can be challenging in SwiftUI, as
  their appearance may be off-putting at first. To address this, I began using
  Blocks to create custom form components and tested them in a playground to
  ensure my forms look great on both iOS and macOS, which is often overlooked.
- **Transport Demo.** Transport features are the ones I use most in the apps
  built on these Blocks. I added a long-overdue demo to help users understand
  them more easily.
- **Misc.** An `.average()` function for collections of numbers (as generic as
  possible), a `yearWeek` property on `PlainDate`, and some Objective-C
  memorabilia.

## 0.5.0 (2024-09-30)

- **Slug creation tool.** A `slugify` function for strings, or anything
  conforming to `StringProtocol`, has been added. There's a demo available in
  the example app, and the function is also accessible through the CLI. I wrote
  [a blog article][1] that explains in detail the requirements, the
  implementation, and provides examples‚Äîincluding emoji characters and various
  alphabets.
- **JSON dictionary merging tool.** A new CLI command can now merge two files
  containing simple string-to-string dictionary objects. [Why might you need
  this?][2]
- **Imported legacy demo app.** This repository is my latest attempt to collect
  useful Swift code for reuse across projects, demos, and proof-of-concepts.
  Learn more about [why `swift-blocks` is already a successful effort][3]. I
  also imported a previous project called Martinet‚Äînamed after the swift bird in
  French, _not_ [the punishment tool for misbehaving children][4]‚Äîas part of
  consolidating my GitHub repositories to reduce maintenance. While it includes
  some legacy features, it brings back fond memories and could be useful in the
  future.
